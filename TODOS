[x] median filters for controls
[x] standardization for controls
[ ] remove audiotools requirement
    [x] from vampnet
    [ ] from DAC? or remove DAC?
[ ] test cfg

DATASETS
[ ] a dataset for melodic // harmonic sounds? 
    - [ ] maybe do hpss on the audio as preprocessing or something crazy
        - [ ] or demucs
        - [ ] or just use a melodic
[ ] orchestral dataset? 
[ ] jazz? 
[ ] minimalist // electroacoustic? 

for an electroacoustic performance
[ ] evaluate actual interactivity with an instrument

puredata
[ ] midi sync (for beat-based music)
[ ] save loops in a bank (for both)
[ ] stereo panning
[ ] multiple channels at once (goes w/ stereo panning)

[ ] REGRESSION TEST FRAMEWORK
- 10 audio files, 10 different prompt types or interactions we'd like to support
- drum beats, melodics, singing, complex harmonies, complex rhythms, drones // sustained chords

experiments:
[x] need quantization // standardization?
    - YES. compare rms, rmsq128, rmsq16
[ ] right cfg value? 
[ ] stemgen vs vampnet? 
[ ] an eval script with metrics like FAD!


HARDWARE:
[ ] case needs to be a bit taller to acommodate the USB-C panel mount
